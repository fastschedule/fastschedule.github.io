# Fast Timetable

**Fast Timetable** is a web-based schedule viewer for students in the BS CS, CY, SE, AI, and DS departments. It pulls its data from a live, automatically-updated `timetable.json` file, which is generated by a Python script that scrapes the schedule data from an Excel sheet. This project is designed to help students quickly access their department's timetable without hassle.

## Features
- **Department-Specific Timetables**: Quickly view the schedules for BS CS, CY, SE, AI, and DS departments.
- **Auto-Updated Data**: The timetable data is fetched from an Excel sheet using a Python script that automatically scrapes and updates the entries.
- **Web-Based**: Access the timetable anytime via the website: [fastschedule.github.io](https://fastschedule.github.io) *(No money for custom domain yet 😅)*

## Why I Made This?
- **Ease of Use**: I wanted a quick way to check the timetable without sifting through complex documents or cluttered interfaces.
- **I Was Bored**: Sometimes, you just need a project to kill time, and this seemed like the perfect one!
